# Polynomial
Develop class Polynomial. The internal representation of a Polynomial is an array or vector of  terms. Each term contains a coefficient and an exponent, e.g., the term            2x^4          has  the  coefficient  2  and  the  exponent  4.  Develop  a  complete  class  containing  proper  constructor and destructor functions as well as set and get functions. The class should also  provide the following overloaded operator capabilities: 

a. Overload the addition operator (+) to add two Polynomials.    
b. Overload the subtraction operator (-) to subtract two Polynomials.    
c. Overload the assignment operator (=) to assign one Polynomial to another.    
d. Overload the addition assignment operator (+=).    
e. Overload the subtraction assignment operator (-=).
